# Managed Device Instructions without partition 

This setup instructions will allow you to set up and enroll your PC into the Gigplus without using a secondary partition. In the event of program offboarding, your device will be wiped out and reset remotely for security reasons. For security reasons, this device is also very restricted ( i.e. you can’t download files or install any software ). Do not store any personal files in your device and have it dedicated solely for your work in the Gigplus program 


## Step 0. Prerrequisites 

Make sure you:  
* have Windows 11 installed in your system 
* have the Microsoft Authenticator App installed in your phone 
* you have a solid, stable, fast internet connection  
* you have a separate device where you can have a conference call ( phone, tablet or laptop is fine ) 

 

## Step 1. Book you call with Deel  

### 1.1 Follow this link 

Go.oncehub.com/deel-upwork 


### 1.2 Run scannow  

On the left hand side of the deel booking page, you’ll see instructions that will guide you to check that your partition is free of errors and corrupt files.

Search for ‘command prompt’ using windows search ( press windows key )  

![command_prompt](https://github.com/libsyz/gig-instructions/blob/main/command_prompt.png)

Click on ‘run as an administrator’ 

Once in the command prompt, run the command sfc /scannow and press Enter 

![scannow](https://github.com/libsyz/gig-instructions/blob/main/scannow.png)

If the command is failing or showing errors that can't be fixed, it will likely be easier to reset the partition. 
Please contact your manager if you are unsure 

### 1.3 Filling the Deel Booking Form 

* Select a date and time that works well for you 
* Fill in the booking form 

![form](https://github.com/libsyz/gig-instructions/blob/main/form.png)


* Under Your email, use a private email that is always reachable to you. Notifications and confirmations regarding the call will arrive to this email 
* Under Org Division, select Amplify 
* Under SFC /scannow results, select ‘it shows no errors’ ( make sure step 1.2 has been successful ) 

You’re now set up for your call with upwork! In this call, they will share credentials and set you up in your upworkgigplus account 

## Step 2. Get your device ready 

Your windows device needs to be reset before your call with Deel. Start this step 2-3 hours before your appointment takes place 

### 2.1 Resetting Windows 

* Go to the windows bar and type ‘Reset this PC’ 
* Click on the ‘Reset this PC’  dialogue at the top

![recovery](https://github.com/libsyz/gig-instructions/blob/main/recovery.png) 

Under recovery options, select ‘Reset PC’. Before you proceed, make sure that you have saved any important files that you might have in your computer 
After you reset your PC, go through Windows reinstall flow normally until you have to select an account. You should choose “Work or School Account” 
![reset](https://github.com/libsyz/gig-instructions/blob/main/reset.png)
The setup should take you to a screen that looks something like this. At this point, you need to wait for your call with Deel to get your new credentials

## Step 3. Logging into your call with Deel 

* Use your phone or a separate device to log into your call with Deel. Make sure you have completed step 2 and you are ready to start windows with a new work account 
* You will be greeted by an onboarding specialist. Follow his/her instructions throughout the call  

The onboarding specialist will also share your brand new upworkgigplus credentials. The password will likely be a throwaway, and you’ll have to set your own password.  

## Step 4. Log into Gigplus virtual environments 

Now you have successfully enrolled your computer, congrats!  
At GigPlus, we use virtualized environments provided by microsoft to do all our work. To set up your remote environment for MID and V-, do the following 

* Look up remote desktop on windows searchbar and open it 
![open_remote_desktop](https://github.com/libsyz/gig-instructions/blob/main/open_remote_desktop.png)
 
Once in Remote desktop, look for the options button in the UI and click on Subscribe 

![remote_subscribe](https://github.com/libsyz/gig-instructions/blob/main/remote_subscrbe.png)
 
Once you hit subscribe, you will asked to log in with your microsoft account details 

* Subscribe with your v- credentials 
* Do this step again and subscribe with your MID credentials 

After you are done, you should see a list of virtual computers you can use for both your MID and v- credentials. Use regions that are close to you to get better performance
